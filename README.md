# Call-Center-Performance-Dashboard

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop an interactive Call Center Dashboard using Power BI to monitor call center performance, evaluate agent efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction. This dashboard provides key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights to help improve operational efficiency and decision-making.

## Executive Summary

This Call Center Dashboard is a comprehensive analytical tool designed to visualize and assess call center operations. It provides insights into call volumes, agent performance, customer satisfaction, and response efficiency. The dashboard features dynamic filters, interactive charts, and agent-specific statistics, allowing users to identify trends and areas for improvement. With over 4,000 calls analyzed, this tool helps in optimizing call center workflows and enhancing customer experience.

## Features

Total Answered Calls: 4,054

Total Resolved Calls: 3,646

Average Speed of Answer: 54.75 seconds

Average Customer Satisfaction Rate: 2.76/5

## Findings & Observations
